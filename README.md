FDim is a GUI to compute fractal dimension of a grayscale image. The fractal dimension can be seen as a measure of roughness of the image. Therefore the program can be used to, e.g., compare different textures.

Fractal algorithms supported:
- Capacity Dimension
- Information Dimension
- Correlation Dimension
- Probability Dimension


## Compile

To compile on linux, MAC or Windows (mingw):
- Install and compile wxWidgets
- Build with CMake
- Or use makefiles (edit appropriate and add WXCONFIG, maybe UPX)
