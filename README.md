fdim
====

GUI to compute fractal dimension of an image


## Compile

To compile on linux, MAC or Windows (mingw):
- Install and compile wxWidgets
- Edit the appropriate makefile to point to WXCONFIG
- You may also want to point the makefile to UPX (for packing the binary)
- Run the appropriate make file, e.g. make -f Makefile.linux

The binary 'fdim' will be in the build subdirectory. It may be that
you have to create the build subdirectory before compiling (mkdir build).
